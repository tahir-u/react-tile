# React Tile

## Overview
React Tile is a component library for creating a one-dimensional grid based tile output for different shapes, including numbers, letters, and emojies, to name a few.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance

## Coming soon
* Support for more shapes, including letters, objects (geometric shapes, emojies)
* Support for custom shape input (TBD)
